This plugin creates an admin-side interface for programatically adding new Game posts. For the new games.studlife.com crossword functionality (Launched 10/31/2204), we use custom posts ("games") to allow users to navigate directly to a specific game, embeded on that post via an iframe. 

This plugin helps users create those posts.
